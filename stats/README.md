# NOTES
A. is there any method for gibbs sampling?
B. have a look at @mle and @dfittool

# TODO
1. @bayes_mcmc2_null, and/or @bayes_mcmc_null (with contrasts)
3. @bayes_mcmc2_plot
4. @bayes_mcmc_rope
5. model_bayes (for grid)
6. model_bayes (for mcmc)
7. gaussian processes
9. bayes_sample_* methods? give modularity to bayes_mcmc_*

# DONE
2. @bayes_mcmc1_plot
8. fix bug with prior/likelihood in bayes_mcmc1_null
