1. *fix* the glm FIR function yields different results for equivalent first beta/contrast - and I don't know why
2. in tbte all information about the onset type is lost. this is crucial when using this information for the RSA - find a better way
3. find an efficient way of defining models in fake_rsa
4. filter RSA, concatenate RSA
5. re-sort RDMs, shrink RDMs
