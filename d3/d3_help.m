function d3_help()
    %% D3_HELP()
    % d3 is a toolbox to display data through web-browser, using d3.js
    %
    % d3 is not a web service. it creates a temporal webserver that
    % displays the necessary HTML/javascript code to plot your data,
    % and then turns off. it doesn't create multiple processes and
    % doesn't require any additional toolbox either. it only
    % requires having a browser installed that supports for HTML5.
    %
    % if you want to see an example, try to run
    % >> d3_example();
    %
    % function d3_figure() will display your data in a new browser page
    % however, it takes inputs in a very specific format.
    % function d3_data() is meant to format your data in the way that is
    % required by d3_figure().
    %
    % kinds of charts:
    %   + plot
    %   + grid2D
