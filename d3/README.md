things to do:

1. move away from D3, try HighCharts this instead
http://www.highcharts.com/
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20572744/how-to-export-a-highchart-chart-to-pdf-thanks-to-a-button-outside-the-chart

2. decide whether to use node & angular js, or to stay with the matlab-based web-server?
